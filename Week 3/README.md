So as for Week 3, we were given the task to build a To Do List Application. I wanted my application to work like a Planner, like I am able to add tasks for each day and they get saved. For that 
I needed to integrate my application with calender and also make a database or allowing my tasks to be saved on local storage but as of now i havent gained much proficiency in that. Although
I am working on it and will be updating as soon as i learn, but this is my work for now.
A of now my application named Chore Lore can add my tasks, delete tasks and categorize them as All, Pending and Completed.
